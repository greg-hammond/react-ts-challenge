# react-ts-challenge

## project requirements:

- react app with typescript
- styled-components


## UI requirements:

- header describing what each challenge does, e.g. "temperature converter"
- input element
- output area for result of each function
- basic styling as appropriate


## individual challenges:

- Temperature converter: converts Celsius <=> Fahrenheit (both ways)
- Palindrome checker: 
    - return boolean whether input is a palindrome.
    - must use recursion.
    - must not use .reverse() method.
- Prime factorization using recursion.
    - return list of prime factors, I suppose.


## implementation roadblocks

had trouble with npx and c-r-a global version.
fixed via

npx clear-npx-cache

then i was able to

npx create-react-app react-ts-challenge --template typescript
